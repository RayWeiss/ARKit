The work listed was completed the previous week and reviewed at the specified date.


Week 1, Jan 16:
	Discussed course expectations
	Planned work to complete for next meeting

Week 2, Jan 23:
	BasicARScene
		+Shows a basic AR scene/session setup and static object placement

Week 3, Jan 30:
	DynamicObjectPlacement
		+Allows a user to add spheres to a scene with a tap gesture
		+Spheres can be selected by tapping on them
		+Selected spheres can be moved around or removed from the scene
		+Movement/removal is done via buttons/pinch gesture

Week 4, Feb 06:
	Did Fix
		-Moved SCNNode extension to separate file
		-Moved ControlPanel layout logic to function
		-Removed explicit call to viewDidLayoutSubviews, called in handleShake instead
		-Moved code from ARSceneViewController extension to class

	EnhancedDynamicObjectPlacement
		+Additional view to handle configuration options for prototyping, accessed via swipe gesture
		+Placement of different shape objects
		+Updated object selection style
		+Moved code to "select" objects from SCNNode extension to SCNNode subclass -> SelectableNode
		+Can select color of object to be placed
		+Placement of objects from model files

Week 5, Feb 13:
	Did Fix
		-Moved model to root VC
		-Made ConfigurationViewController a property of ARSceneViewController
	
	GravityPhysics
		+Object movement relative to user, not world origin
		+Object physics
		+Object gravity

Week 6, Feb 20:
	HeadingArrow
		+Added arrow model to project
		+Made arrow appear near users feet
		+Made arrow "follow" user by maintaining a static distance and orientation from user
		+Added core location manager and oriented world origin to true north heading

Week 7, Feb 27:
	Did Fix
		-Moved constants to properties
		-Refactored code
	
	ImprovedHeadingArrow
		+Made arrow point to placed "trackable" node


Week 8, Mar 6:
	JourneyOfNodes:
		+Made ARSceneViewController keep track of placed waypoints
		+Made arrow point to waypoint selected from picker
		+Added transition animator to handle swipe gesture transitions

Week 9, Mar 13:
	LocationIntegration
		+Set up location manager to wait for accurate heading before loading AR scene
		+Set up location manager to update location until a threshold is reached
		+Added RealWorldNode to store coordinates of nodes location in the real world
		+Made ReadWorldNode encodable to save state
		+Added map to store AR World Origin's coordinates in the real world

Week 10, Mar 20:
	LocationIntegrationEnhancement
		+Cleaned up and refactored persistence code
		+Added user alerts for Save and Load functions
		+Added datetime information to node name
		+Removed incorrect setting of RWNode location to realWorldConversionMap coordinates
		+Added user info for location accuracy
		+Arrow points to loaded node

Week XX, Mar 27:
	Spring Recess - No Meeting

Week 11, April 3:
	ModifiableWaypoints
		+Added ability to remove waypoints from scene
		+Added ability to save / load ALL waypoints in scene
		+Created code-able WaypointContainer
	
Week 12, April 10:
	NameableWaypoints
		+Added ability to edit names of waypoints
		+Implemented use of UUIDs to identify and access placed waypoints
		+Added slider on configuration page for scale of waypoints
		+Made waypoints be placed with geometry selected from configuration vc
		+Made waypoints be placed with color selected from configuration vc

Week 13, April 17:
	Implement editing of currently placed waypoints
		Edit from newly displayed VC from edit row action
		Edit from AR scene view
	Begin implementation of transition once user is within give proximity of waypoint

********************************************************************
Drop down for sub-details view, click from sub details view to full details view


Final Expectations

Last meeting?

Final Feature Decisions / Expectations
	+ Edit names (on details page or from tableview?)
	+ Ability to rearrange waypoints
	+Ability to edit properties of waypoints already placed
	+ Is the collection ordered or unordered? Is this a path or a collection of related objects without a set order? Does it matter? 
		- If it is ... recognize when a user is at a waypoint and switch to the next

	+ Auto-save / load (how to handle location / heading accuracy?)
	+ Unique waypoint id's for accessing and saving (related to auto-save/load)	*** -> let uuid = UUID().uuidString OR CFUUIDCreate(_:)
	+ Click waypoints for "details page"
		- Detail page will display name and notes about the waypoint
		- Waypoint attributes will be editable from details page
			> Notes
			> Geometry
			> Color
			> Scale

	+ Display distance of selected waypoint from users current position
	+ On screen "radar" map of close waypoints
	+ Separate view for map of user location and all waypoints



NOTES
+++++++++++++++++
let uuid = UUID().uuidString
FUUIDCreate(_:)


Var timer: Timer?
{
	willSet {
		newValue
	}
}



--------------------------------------------------------------------
Future:
	Make arrow point back north if you delete waypoint currently being tracked
	Add ability to rearrange waypoints
	Add ability to rename waypoints
	Circle with 2D view of waypoints / Map for placed waypoints
	Recognize when a user is at a waypoint and switch to the next

	Move out literal values from persistence view controller
	MapKit for distanceFrom and atDegreesLatitude


X	Remove constants from code and move to properties
	Plane recognition and placement of plane objects
	Double tap on object to move to closest plane
	SceneKit editor
	CoreLocation
	CoreML
	Struct for angles, able to return radians or degrees
	Is ARSceneViewController the appropriate place for the calculateXZAngle function?
	If not where should it go?
		extend SCNVector3
		extend SCNNode (can't use ARCamera)
		possible helpers class
