The work listed was completed the previous week and reviewed at the specified date.


Week 1, Jan 16:
	Discussed course expectations
	Planned work to complete for next meeting

Week 2, Jan 23:
	BasicARScene
		+Shows a basic AR scene/session setup and static object placement

Week 3, Jan 30:
	DynamicObjectPlacement
		+Allows a user to add spheres to a scene with a tap gesture
		+Spheres can be selected by tapping on them
		+Selected spheres can be moved around or removed from the scene
		+Movement/removal is done via buttons/pinch gesture

Week 4, Feb 06:
	Did Fix
		-Moved SCNNode extension to separate file
		-Moved ControlPanel layout logic to function
		-Removed explicit call to viewDidLayoutSubviews, called in handleShake instead
		-Moved code from ARSceneViewController extension to class

	EnhancedDynamicObjectPlacement
		+Additional view to handle configuration options for prototyping, accessed via swipe gesture
		+Placement of different shape objects
		+Updated object selection style
		+Moved code to "select" objects from SCNNode extension to SCNNode subclass -> SelectableNode
		+Can select color of object to be placed
		+Placement of objects from model files

Week 5, Feb 13:
	Did Fix
		-Moved model to root VC
		-Made ConfigurationViewController a property of ARSceneViewController
	
	GravityPhysics
		+Object movement relative to user, not world origin
		+Object physics
		+Object gravity

Week 6, Feb 20:
	HeadingArrow
		+Added arrow model to project
		+Made arrow appear near users feet
		+Made arrow "follow" user by maintaining a static distance and orientation from user
		+Added core location manager and oriented world origin to true north heading

Week 7, Feb 27:
	Did Fix
		-Moved constants to properties
		-Refactored code
	
	ImprovedHeadingArrow
		+Made arrow point to placed "trackable" node


Week 8, Mar 6:
	JourneyOfNodes:
		+Made ARSceneViewController keep track of placed waypoints
		+Made arrow point to waypoint selected from picker
		+Added transition animator to handle swipe gesture transitions

Week 9, Mar 13:
	Integration with CoreLocation
	Save state of waypoints

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Future:
	Recognize when a user is at a waypoint and switch to the next
	Add ability to remove waypoints
	Add ability to rename waypoints


X	Remove constants from code and move to properties
	Plane recognition and placement of plane objects
	Double tap on object to move to closest plane
	SceneKit editor
	CoreLocation
	CoreML
	Struct for angles, able to return radians or degrees
	Is ARSceneViewController the appropriate place for the calculateXZAngle function?
	If not where should it go?
		extend SCNVector3
		extend SCNNode (can't use ARCamera)
		possible helpers class
