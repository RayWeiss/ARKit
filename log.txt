		+Placement of objects from model files

Week 5, Feb 13:
	Did Fix

	GravityPhysics
		+Object movement relative to user, not world origin
		+Object physics
		+Object gravity

Week 6, Feb 20:
	HeadingArrow
		+Added arrow model to project
		+Made arrow appear near users feet
		+Made arrow "follow" user by maintaining a static distance and orientation from user
		+Added core location manager and oriented world origin to true north heading

Week 7, Feb 27:
	Did Fix
		-Moved constants to properties
		-Refactored code
	
	ImprovedHeadingArrow
		+Made arrow point to placed "trackable" node


Week 8, Mar 6:
	JourneyOfNodes:
		+Made ARSceneViewController keep track of placed waypoints
		+Made arrow point to waypoint selected from picker
		+Added transition animator to handle swipe gesture transitions

Week 9, Mar 13:
	LocationIntegration
		+Set up location manager to wait for accurate heading before loading AR scene
		+Set up location manager to update location until a threshold is reached
		+Added RealWorldNode to store coordinates of nodes location in the real world
		+Made ReadWorldNode encodable to save state
		+Added map to store AR World Origin's coordinates in the real world

Week 10, Mar 20:
	LocationIntegrationEnhancement
		+Cleaned up and refactored persistence code
		+Added user alerts for Save and Load functions
		+Added datetime information to node name
		+Removed incorrect setting of RWNode location to realWorldConversionMap coordinates
		+Added user info for location accuracy
		+Arrow points to loaded node

Week XX, Mar 27:
	Spring Recess - No Meeting

Week 11, April 3:
	ModifiableWaypoints
		+Added ability to remove waypoints from scene
		+Added ability to save / load ALL waypoints in scene
		+Created code-able WaypointContainer
	
Week 12, April 10:
	NameableWaypoints
		+Added ability to edit names of waypoints
		+Implemented use of UUIDs to identify and access placed waypoints
		+Added slider on configuration page for scale of waypoints
		+Made waypoints be placed with geometry selected from configuration vc
		+Made waypoints be placed with color selected from configuration vc

Week 13, April 17:
	ObjectEditingAbility
		+Added ability to change color of placed waypoints
		+Added ability to change geometry of placed waypoints
		+Added ability to size of placed waypoints

Week 14, April 24th:
	ProximityDisplay
		+Added view to display distance of currently selected waypoint to user in ARSceneView
		+Added ability to select Waypoints from ARSceneView

Week 14, May 1st:
	ReachedWaypoint
		+Added alert when user reaches currently selected waypoint
		+Added option to switch to next waypoint once current waypoint is reached
		+Added marking of waypoint with color once user reaches it
	

********************************************************************
TODO
	Edit name of placed waypoint
	Edit placed waypoints from AR scene view
	Point to "next waypoint" once user is within give proximity of waypoint
	Add "details" to waypoints
		Drop down for sub-details view, click from sub details view to full details view




Feature Decisions
	+ Ability to rearrange waypoints
	+ Is the collection ordered or unordered? Is this a path or a collection of related objects without a set order? Does it matter? 
		- If it is ... recognize when a user is at a waypoint and switch to the next

	+ Auto-save / load (how to handle location / heading accuracy?)
	+ Click waypoints for "details page"
		- Detail page will display name and notes about the waypoint
		- Waypoint attributes will be editable from details page
			> Notes
			> Geometry
			> Color
			> Scale

	+ Display distance of selected waypoint from users current position
	+ On screen "radar" map of close waypoints
	+ Separate view for map of user location and all waypoints


--------------------------------------------------------------------
Old:
	Make arrow point back north if you delete waypoint currently being tracked
	Add ability to rearrange waypoints
	Circle with 2D view of waypoints / Map for placed waypoints
	Recognize when a user is at a waypoint and switch to the next
