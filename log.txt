		Move model to root VC
		Make ConfigurationViewController a property of ARSceneViewController

	Planned
		Object movement relative to user, not world origin
		Object physics/collision
		Plane recognition and placement of plane objects
		Double tap on object to move to closest plane (gravity)
		Slide object across plane so that it can "lead user", fixed distance from user

Future:
	SceneKit editor
	CoreLocation
	CoreML
