## User Guide

The final app allows a user to interact with their current world via augmented reality.
It is implemented using Appleâ€™s ARKit library for iOS devices. The app functions
best outside because it uses GPS services. To use the app, start it and wait for
the first screen to disappear once heading accuracy has improved or bypass via
the button. The augmented reality screen starts next. Wait for the status bar
in the bottom left to turn all green. Waypoints can be placed via a double tap
in the world. A 45 second timer can be started via the start button to challenge
a user to collected as many waypoints as possible in the time limit. This
functionality can be reset via the reset button. Default waypoint types are
shown and editable in the default settings screen accessed via a left swipe. All
waypoints in the scene can be seen in the list view accessed via a right swipe.
Waypoints in this list can be edited with different options shown if you swipe left
on them individually. Waypoints can be saved and loaded via the screen
accessible by an up swipe. They are saved according to their current latitude and
longitude. Precision is affected by current heading accuracy and location
accuracy. Using the set thresholds, the error radius is approximately 18 meters.
